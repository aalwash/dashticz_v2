Basic installation instructions
###############################

Since Beta 2.4.6 (October 2018) the installation instruction changed. Main reason is that for most functionality PHP support in the web server is needed. The Domoticz web server doesn't support PHP. That means that Dashticz needs to be installed under a different web server with PHP enabled. 
The installation instruction consists in two steps:

* Installation of a web server
* Installation of Dashticz v2

Installation of a web server
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
This example shows installation of Apache on Raspberry in it's most basic configuration: running at port 80.
Besides Apache also PHP needs to be installed, since it's used by the Calendar and Garbage module in Dashticz.

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo apt-get update
    sudo apt-get install apache2
    sudo apt-get install php
    sudo apt-get install php-xml php-curl
    sudo systemctl restart apache2

.. note:: On some Raspberry configurations the installation of php is failing. In that case you can try the alternative installs under Advanced Installation below

Now check whether Apache is running by browsing to ``http://<YOUR IP>``
You should see the Apache demo page.

Installation of Dashticz v2
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Example for Raspberry PI running Apache web server:
Assumption:

* Apache is running at ``http://192.168.1.3`` on the default port 80 (but this can be any IP:port address)
* Domoticz is running at ``http://192.168.1.3:8084``

First clone the dashticz repository to a folder of your choice:

.. code-block:: bash

    cd /home/pi
    git clone https://github.com/robgeerts/dashticz_v2 --branch beta

After the installation is finished, go to the ``/home/pi/dashticz_v2/custom/`` folder, copy the CONFIG_DEFAULT.js file to CONFIG.js (mind the CAPITALS!), and edit it with the basics:

.. code-block:: bash
    cd dashticz_v2/custom/
    cp CONFIG_DEFAULT.js CONFIG.js
    nano CONFIG.js

Example of CONFIG.js:

.. code-block:: javascript

    var config = {}
    config['language'] = 'nl_NL'; //or: en_US, de_DE, fr_FR, hu_HU, it_IT, pt_PT, sv_SV
    config['domoticz_ip'] = 'http://192.168.1.3:8084';
    config['domoticz_refresh'] = '5';
    config['dashticz_refresh'] = '60';
